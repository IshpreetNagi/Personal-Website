# Personal-Website V1
This website acted as my digital portfolio, allowing me to showcase my personality, achievements, and skillset in an accessible manner. It is programmed using vanilla HTML and CSS, with some interactive elements coming from JavaScript. It was my first endeavor into front-end web development, but certainly not my last. I have recently taken the deployment of this site offline as I work on version 2, which would take advantage of the skills and experience I have acquired since. 

### Development Requirements
- HTML >= 5
- CSS >= 4.15
- JavaScript >= 1.8
