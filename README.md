# Personal-Website
I programmed my own website using my acquired web development skills in HTML, CSS, and experience in Javascript. The construction of this website set the foundation for me to build off and expand on it for it to blossom into a platform where I could assemble all my pieces of work and showcase who I am as a person. All while allowing me to truly showcase my skills, abilities, and interests in the various fields of technology, using my passion of programming for the creation method.

NOTE: This website is still a work in progress, multiple-screen support is yet to be implemented, and I am working on bringing it up to date with my current projects. If you encounter any bugs or issues with the site, feel free to notify me about it at: ishpreetnagi@gmail.com.
