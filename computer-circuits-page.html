            Throughout my high school years, I had become a part of multiple computer engineering courses offered by my school throughout the years of grade 10, 11, and 12. These years were very insightful as they rewarded me with the opportunity to learn and gain experience in the world of circuit design as they allowed me to work with all kinds of different circuit components,  computer hardware, and experiment with a variety of circuit building techniques. As my time in the courses progressed, my skill level with these tools only increased along with the list of computer hardware materials I had experience with. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Below I expand on my experience and the skills I was able to perfect through the courses while also touching upon the some challenges I faced. To view some of my circuit creations, please visit my instructable page using the link embedded in the button above. You can also visit my TinkerCAD profile to view simulations of fully functional models I created while in quarantine throughout the pandemic.

            From the very beginning, I was always very proficient with the hardware and hands-on component of computer engineering as I was able to learn and then master working with components at a rather quick pace. However, the only aspect always proving to be a challenge was the code aspect affiliated with each hardware component. Despite being highly experienced in computer programming and application creation, hardware programming was an ordeal for me because of its incorporation of different commands and depending on the hardware component, a different type of coding method. However, after enough time with the component and experience using the parts to construct a variety of circuits, I was able to overcome the challenge which was hardware programming and am now successfully able to program and use a list of varying hardware components with ease.

            Halfway through my time in my grade 11 engineering course, due to the ongoing pandemic, our school was closed for students, thus forcing students to continue through an online learning model. During that period I was unable to actually work with the hardware components via hands-on but rather had to design circuits virtually. However, even that proved to be very educational and allowed me to still gain experience working with the hardware as the online simulator and circuit builder I was using was based on the real-world logic of the hardware. The way the circuits were wired and programmed using code virtually, was the actual way they would be created in real-life given access to the components. Furthermore, since the online circuit creator allowed access to a much greater variety of components compared to the list of components provided by the school, it gave me the opportunity to truly experiment and be able to master components I was previously unfamiliar with.

            In the end, being apart of those computer engineering courses allowed me to open my mind up to a completely different aspect of the technological landscape other than software. It exposed me to a completely different landscape, allowing me to not only expand my skill set in the field of technology but also helping me hone my skill of looking at a problem from a completely different perspective as computer engineering exposed me to such a variety and varying degree of challenges and scenarios, ones rare in other aspects of the technological field.
