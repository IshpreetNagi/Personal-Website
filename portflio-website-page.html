          <p>
            This page, along with the entire website you're currently viewing has been completely created by myself using the methods of HTML, and JavaScript. To further speed development, I used the aid of a free HTML website template, courtesy of Free CSS. However, I modified and added new features and techniques to the template completely independently using the knowledge I had acquired from all my time working with the languages and online site creation in general. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the entire development of the site, the only major challenge I encountered was understanding and unraveling the previously foregin techniques the template was incorporating. The template was using the techniques and methods I had previously learned in HTML and JavaScript, but in a format I was unfamiliar with. The structure of it was in an unconventional way that took me a while to understand. I was at first greatly overwhelmed by the template, but as I continued to work on it and refine it, I was able to unwind and reverse engineering it from the ground up. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The template essentially only provided me with the main formatting outline of the information on the home page, along with the key Javascript interactable elements. To elaborate, some of the major Javascript elements the template provided to me were the navigation sidebar which can be accessed from the right hand side of the website, and the four boxes which can be seen on the home page in the ‘Technological Skillset’ section, specifically, the animation of the boxes scrolling up to reveal more information triggered by the cursor. However, all content supplied by the template was essentially only the solid foundation for me to build off of, as once I had invested the time to reworking and refining some of the backend coding techniques the template was using along with the stylistic elements of the template, my vision for the site had come into fruition.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest features I was able to implement into the site was multi-page support. The template was originally only giving me one home page, I then went in and created multiple pages around the site, each page housing information on a completely different one of my projects. This division of the site helped to not only make it more intricate and detailed, but also allowed for better organization of information overall. Then to make the backend coding much easier for me while trying to organize, and customize the multiple pages, I made it so all the pages of the website communicate with one style sheet instead of using different style sheets like other sites. Unifying all the pages through one style sheet allowed for easy changes to be made to separate aspects of different pages, easily letting me keep certain stylistic elements the same, and cutting down a lot of redundant code that would typically come from individual CSS pages for each HTML page. Moreover, to make accessing those multiple pages easy and user friendly all while looking aesthetically pleasing, I repurposed the picture gallery style assortment of pictures provided by the template and altered it to make it so the pictures are essentially types of buttons which once clicked while take you to the page regarding that project so one could learn more about it. Along with multi-page support, all other aesthetic changes, buttons, links, written content, pictures, and logos have all been my creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the template only equipped me with the bare minimum, setting the foundation for me to build off and expand on it for it to blossom into a platform where I could assemble all my pieces of work and showcase who I am as a person. All while allowing me to truly showcase my skills, abilities, and interests in the various fields of technology using my passion as the creation method, computer programming.
