            This project was created for the ‘HackItShipIt’ hackathon hosted by Major League Hacking (MLH) that took place over the summer of 2020. Much like all the other hackathon projects listed, this one also targeted a real-world issue. To learn more about the final project, it’s inner workings, and some challenges faced in its production, feel free to visit the project Devpost page using the button above.

            The objective of the device was to keep birds, specifically seagulls away from oil spills that occur in large bodies of water all over the world. The ‘B.P.B: Bird Protection Buoy’ is essentially a buoy that would be deployed around the oil affected area within the body of water. They would be deployed in sets around the entirety of the oil spill, surrendering it from all sides. Once activated, they would emit a certain frequency that has the potential of causing mild irritation in a wide variety of birds, however would be specifically tailored to target seagulls. That irritation would result in the birds wanting to stay as far away from the area as possible, therefore it would result in birds staying away from the oil-contaminated zone while workers can work to try and clean up the mess.  Once the spill has been cleaned up, the buoys could be picked up and reused whenever and wherever the next oil spill occurs.

            Overall this device was targeted to minimize if not eliminate the amount of birds that are harmed by the disasters of oil spills, as birds are one of the most affected by these oil based castrophies.

            During the creation of this project, I took up the role of being the group’s unofficial leader. I played a big part in helping spread out tasks, manage everyone's work, and the overall pacing of the workflow to allow completion of the project by the tight 24-hour deadline. I would constantly stay in touch with group mates to track their progress and maintain a stable workflow and steady progression. I would also help set up times at which we can meet together to discuss the overall progress of the group. During those meetings, I would make sure we always stayed on track and did not get distracted by unwork-related chatter, therefore not allowing a waste of the already little time. Moreover, I would also greatly help boost the morale of the group as I would continually encourage and motivate my peers to keep going while also praising the completed work as a way to let them know the effort that was being put was not going unnoticed.
