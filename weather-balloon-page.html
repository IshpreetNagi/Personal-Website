            Earlier this year, my school’s robotics team and I took on the challenge of creating a stratospheric balloon completely independently. The goal for this project was to successfully launch a payload 30 kilometers high into the atmosphere in order to capture a picture and recording of the journey, one we can claim as our own.

            To learn more about the project, such as some specific details regarding the budget, our funding streams, and overall payload design, feel free to pay a visit to the ‘Stratospheric Balloon Information Document’ using the link provided above.

            This project required me to tread on forgein ground, as it involved one to be very knowledgeable in the aspects of aerial travel, something I had previously been unfamiliar with. However I was successfully able to adapt and quickly become accustomed with the information and concepts the project was dealing with to become a prominent member of the entire operation. To be more specific this endeavour awarded me the opportunity to learn about the issues one needs to be mindful of when planning a launch of this scale, and all that must go into planning an appropriate launch day. Much of my time was invested on researching wind currents along with weather reports to pinpoint an appropriate day of launch for the balloon itself. Since the helium balloon itself is so fragile, it must be launched under ideal weather conditions to avoid damage and rupture upon ascend. Furthermore, since it is important the payload be retrieved after the completion of its mission to actually be able to retrieve the recording and pictures of the earth from that height, it was important we be mindful of wind currents to ensure that the balloon does not touchdown within a body of water or land across the borders, thereby running all possibilities of retrieving the payload and thus brining a grim end to the project as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond learning about the concepts and conducting research, some of my other responsibilities included researching components, helping to manage the budget, and helping in completing tasks such as the PowerPoint slideshow presentation used to inform possible investors about our project while also using it to pitch the entire idea to the Peel education board to receive a healthy amount of funding from them.

            Moreover, I would occasionally take the central leadership role. I would overall control the progress on the project to ensure that it moves forward at a steady and efficient pace. I also would also take it upon myself to visit vendors of critical resources required by the project. Visiting them ensured that all products were coming from reliable and official sources, thereby ensuring product quality. Furthermore, I would continually stay in contact with all groupmates to keep a track of everyone’s well-being, making sure they don’t feel overwhelmed by the tasks assigned to them.

        Unfortunately, as we approached closer to the actual launch date, things only increased to worsen. The COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time resulted in a multitude of scheduling issues, time restrictions, and travel concerns, resulting in bringing the launch of the project to a complete standstill. However, it is with great excitement I can report that the project has been passed down to the next generation of robotic students at my previous high school, Jean Augustine Secondary School (JASS). As sad as I am that I am unable to bring to fruition the project I embarked on with my 4 close friends by having a successful launch ourselves, I am happy to have passed the project on to the capable hands of the next generation of engineers - and hopefully, in 2023 - we can finally see this project achieve the goal we initally set out with.
